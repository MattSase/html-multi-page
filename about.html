            <p class="info">Hi my name is Matthew I like watching funny and horror movies, also I can't forget about anime! For gaming I like horror and action/adventure games. 
                Video Games is why I got into coding, also I took a program called TECH360 back in highschool which opened me to learn code.
                Languages that I am familar with are python, C++, Java, and JavaScript I still am continuously learning how to use these programming langauges to improve and it is difficult T_T.
                My goal is to become a game developer or designer working with SONY or Microsoft who knows maybe Nintendo or another big gaming company, not gonna lie people be underrating Nintendo.
                I am also interested in how to code website applications it sounds fun. I feel I would like doing the front-end because you get to put your imagination/artisitc skills at work.
